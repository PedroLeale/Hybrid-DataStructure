# Hybrid-DataStructure
A hybrid data structure to store Strings, expected to be used for Heuristics for Bitcoin Forensics.<br />
Currently focusing on Heuristic H1, wich checks for same input addresses in different transactions, it makes heavy use of intersection and union functions.<br />
Eventually this project will become a external crate at crates.io to be used openly.<br />
This project is also part of my scientific initiation at UFU (Federal university of Uberl√¢ndia - Brazil).<br />

## Details about the project

It is a hybrid data structure that contains a BtreeSet and a BloomFilter.
The BloomFilter's goal is to optimize "contains" methods without compromising insertions.<br />
The current code is still on the optimization process but is relatively fast.<br />

## For the future updates:
* Make a better way of concatenating the iterators, because of borrowing issues, otherwise from my testings it works.<br />
* Make a function that returns iterators with the intersection itself, for the heuristics just a boolean value is enough, but I want it to make this structure more useful for other cases.<br />
* Find a way that deals with duplicates from Unions without a big impact on performance.<br />
* I also want to test other Tree sets so the user can choose the best solution for the case.


## Things I have already tried
* I tried to make it generic, not only for strings, but I don't know why it lost 40% performance since typing should be dealt with in compile time, not run time.<br />
* Also tried to make only one TreeSet and a list of BloomFilters, but it ended up consuming so much memory that it crashes when I test it with millions of strings.
The goal of this was to deal with duplicates from unions.
